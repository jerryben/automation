Welcome to my DevOps Automation Projects Repository! This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on exercises and personal projects focused on automating cloud infrastructure and configuration management using Terraform, Ansible, and other DevOps tools.

## 📜 Overview

This repository is a compilation of my automation scripts and configurations aimed at simplifying and streamlining cloud operations. Whether you're interested in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, configuration management with Ansible, or exploring other DevOps automation tools, this repository provides practical examples and detailed explanations to help you understand and implement automation in your own projects.

### Key Highlights:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automate cloud infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.
- **Configuration Management:** Manage server configurations and automate tasks using Ansible.
- **Multi-Cloud Deployments:** Examples on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Security and Compliance:** Implement security best practices in automated deployments.
- **Reusable Modules:** Modular and reusable code snippets for quick automation.
